Employee Manager – React App

I have built an Employee Manager application where an admin can easily manage employee records with a clean and responsive UI.

Features :
Add Employees
Admin can add new employees with all details.
Data is stored in Local Storage (works like a simple backend).
Employee Table
View a list of all employees in a structured table.
Search functionality – find employees by Name, Department, or Designation.
Remove employees easily when needed.

User Experience :
Mobile Responsive design with Bootstrap.
Smooth navigation between pages using React Router.
Redux is used for state management, making the app more scalable and organized.

Tech Stack:
React.js for UI
Redux for state management
React Router for navigation
Bootstrap for styling & responsiveness
Local Storage for data persistence
